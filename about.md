So how did this came to be? well, since very little I've had the passion for videogames, to see what they do to be different from each other and entertain you as much as possible, and when I had to decide what to do with my life once I finished highschool I thought that, maybe it was possible for someone such as myself to make my own games. I wanted to make sure though so I made a game all on my own only with a few youtube tutorials and gamemaker studio, and it was terrible, don't get me wrong, I think that for my first attempt I did pretty well, but looking back on it now I can see all the huge design mistakes that I made without realizing.

Despite this, I had a blast of a time making it and I especially had fun with the programming part, which made sense to me since I was always good with math, the process of learning by trial and error until everything works out is very satisfying to me. And so I decided to study game design in the Professional Institute Arcos, where I learned Construct2 and Unity. After completing my higher education I started working right away on various different proyects in Digital Gekko, where I mostly took care of programming and some planning.

My way of working is pretty simple, if Im not interested in the proyect then I just do my part as well as I can and move on, but if I am invested then I can spend so much time working just out of passion and go above and beyond to obtain the absolute best result I can. I am definitely way more productive and hardworking when I have a passion for the project.

Besides programming I also enjoy a lot Game Design in general, writing, animating (2D and 3D) and drawing, so if I have to I can help with pretty much any task, kind of a jack of all trades when needed.

And I think that's about it, if you want to know anything else or talk about whatever feel free to [contact me!](https://niquion.github.io/contact)
